-- running this query checks if any of the fb friends that user has have joined good_sees. we wanted to run this on every login. maybe even every friend load page...
-- takes in user id

-- returns new friends or false/null

-- don't know if this function needs to be seperate from get_if_user_exists, we won't need to run it outside of login time
